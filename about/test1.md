# English version of LinkedIn's About section

I started my carrier in 2011 in the field of embedded programming at the company [Behr-Hella Thermocontrol](https://www.bhtc.com/de), where I was a member of the standard software team and primarily responsible for the topic [AUTOSAR](https://www.autosar.org). Starting in this area allowed me to extend my knowledge about programming languages like C and C++, as well as learn a lot about software architectures.

In 2014, I decided to go back to school and worked in parallel as a freelancer for the company [van Rickelen](https://vr-ing.de) to finance my master study. Besides implementing embedded software modules, I developed smaller Desktop applications based on the languages Java, VBA, and C#. Later on, I had the chance to act as the lead developer of a bigger project and also contributed to the development of the system architecture.

In 2018, I dared to start a startup with two friends, which we, unfortunately, had to stop at the end of 2019. It was about Blockchain-based identities and continues living in the project [Blockchain-Based Authentication](https://github.com/blobaa). In the course of the startup, I worked mainly with languages like JavaScript and TypeScript and technologies like Node.js, React.js, Next.js, and React Native to develop prototypes and demonstrators.

As achievements, besides others, we won an [Online Hackathon](https://www.jelurida.com/news/ardor-online-hackathon-winners) for the [Ardor Blockchain](https://www.jelurida.com/ardor) and managed to reach the third place in a challenge of the [Odyssey Hackathon](https://www.odyssey.org/odyssey-hackathon-2019/). Odyssey describes itself as the biggest blockchain and AI hackathon.

All in all, I enjoyed developing for many platforms and with many technologies. I've developed modules for embedded systems, created desktop and mobile applications, and implemented cloud-based prototypes and projects.

In general, I always enjoy new challenges and technologies and love to learn new things. I am also a big fan of e-learning platforms and open-source software.
